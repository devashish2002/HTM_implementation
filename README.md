# HTM_implementation

The core idea of the project is to design an appropriate model for the prediction of a body
activity from the readings of three gyro sensors fitted on the body with the help of Hierarchical
Temporal Memory (HTM) algorithms. Unlike most other machine learning methods, HTM learns
time-based patterns in unlabeled data on a continuous basis and is thus able to give online predictions.
